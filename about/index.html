title: About EU Code Week
---








<p>In 2017 EU Code Week will take place between <strong>7 and 22 October</strong>.</p>

<p>EU Code Week is a grass-roots movement that celebrates creating with code. The idea is to make programming more visible, to show young, adults and elderly how you bring ideas to life with code, to demystify these skills and bring motivated people together to learn. The initiative was launched in 2013 by the Young Advisors for the Digital Agenda Europe.</p>

<p>EU Code Week is run by volunteers. One, or several, <a href="http://events.codeweek.eu/ambassadors">Code Week Ambassadors</a> coordinate the initiative in their countries, but everyone can organise their own code event and add it to the <a href="http://codeweek.eu">codeweek.eu</a> map. </p>

<p>In 2016, nearly a million people in more than 50 countries around the world took part in EU Code Week. If your country is not involved yet, you can organise events and put it on the <a href="http://events.codeweek.eu">map</a> or <a href="mailto:info@codeweek.eu">volunteer</a> as a Code Week ambassador.</p>

<p>As part of its strategy for a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/">Digital Single Market</a>, the European Commission supports EU Code Week and other independent initiatives which aim to boost digital skills, including programming, for different target groups. In June 2016 the Commission adopted the <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2039_en.htm">New Skills Agenda Europe</a>, which addresses digital skills across 10 concrete actions. One of the actions is the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/digital-skills-jobs-coalition">Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition</a>, which brings together regional and national authorities, businesses, non-profit organisations, education providers and social partners who commit to take action to increase digital skills in Europe. The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/national-local-coalitions">National Digital Skills and Jobs Coalitions</a> are often involved in EU Code Week.</p>

<p>Alessandro Bogliolo, coordinator of the EU Code Week team of 90 volunteers said:</p>
<blockquote><p>"From the beginning of time we did many things using stone, iron, paper and pencil that have transformed our lives. Now we live in a different era where our world is moulded in code. Different eras have different jobs and skills demand. During Code Week we want to give every European the opportunity to discover coding and have fun with it. Let’s learn coding to shape our future".</p></blockquote>


<h2>Why coding?</h2>

<p>It's about Pia, who felt like she had to study law, even though she always enjoyed maths and playing with computers. It's about Mark, who has the idea for a better social network, but can't build it on his own. It's about Alice, who dreams about making robots because her parents don't allow her to have a cat.</p>

<p>It's about Karl, who's bored of his career in marketing and wants a new challenge and his colleague, Mila, a project manager who just can't seem to speak the same language as software developers on the project. It's about Linda, who wants to start her own company, it's about Leo, a talented designer, who wants to show his clients how his design really works, not just looks like. We're sure you've heard many stories like these.</p>

<p>It's about those of you who are already helping these dreams come true.</p>

<p>Actually, it's about all of us. Our future. Technology is shaping our lives, but we're letting a minority decide what and how we use it for. We can do better than just sharing and liking stuff. We can bring our crazy ideas to life, build things that will bring joy to others.</p>

<p>It's never been easier to make your own app, build your own robot, or invent flying cars, why not! It's not an easy journey, but it's a journey full of creative challenges, a supportive community, and tons of fun. Are you ready to accept the challenge and become a <strong>maker</strong>?</p>
