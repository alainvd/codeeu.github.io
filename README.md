# Europe Code Week website

The website was created with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It's a Ruby gem
(library). To contribute:

1. Make sure you have Ruby and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed.  
2. Fork the repository on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button.  
3. Clone the repository to your computer.  
4. In the repository folder on your machine, run `bundle install` to have the
   project's dependencies installed.

After that, you can run the following command to preview locally the changes
you make on the website:

	jekyll serve --watch

Then open [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) and you should be able to 
see the site.

Request for review.
