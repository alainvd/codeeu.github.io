Ireland was undoubtedly the hero of the first ever Europe Code Week! To learn more about what was going on last week all over the country, take a look at the great follow up [video](https://vimeo.com/81054753) created by the [Galway Education Centre](http://www.galwayec.ie), featuring Irish #codeEU ambassador [Julie Cullen](https://twitter.com/cullej29).

We also hope Ireland keeps on coding and can't wait to do even more together next year!
